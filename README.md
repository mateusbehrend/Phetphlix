This repo contains a movie recommender API. This movie recommender recommends a list of movies based on an user's past watch history. Each one of their past movies seen has had its genre, actors, and director tallied. These factors are then used to score all movies in database that user could watch. The recommender then outputs the most compatible movies for that user based on that given scoring system. This API implements a predetermined database of users and movies, and the algorithum is centered on BSTs to allow for both efficent storing of data, and searching.
